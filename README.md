# Albion Data - Client
Distributed client for the [Albion Data](https://albion-data.com/)
project.

A quick note on the legality of this application and if it
violates the Terms and Conditions for Albion Online. Here is
the response from SBI when asked if we are allowed to do
monitor network packets relating to Albion Online:
> Our position is quite simple. As long as you just look and
analyze we are ok with it. The moment you modify or manipulate
something or somehow interfere with our services we will react
(e.g. perma-ban, take legal action, whatever).
